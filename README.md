2. Easy to [convert SVG code](https://svgr.now.sh/) to react-native-svg.

## Installation

### With expo

> âœ… The [Expo client app](https://expo.io/tools) comes with the native code installed!

Install the JavaScript with:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-svg
```

ðŸ“š See the [**Expo docs**](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/svg/) for more info or jump ahead to [Usage](#usage).

### With react-native-cli

1. Install library

   from npm

   ```bash
   npm install react-native-svg
   ```

   from yarn

   ```bash
   yarn add react-native-svg
   ```

2. Link native code

## Support for Fabric

[Fabric](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/fabric-renderer) is React Native's new rendering system. As of [version `13.0.0`](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg/releases/tag/v13.0.0) of this project, Fabric is supported only for react-native 0.69.0+. Support for earlier versions is not possible due to breaking changes in configuration.

| react-native-svg | react-native |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| >=13.0.0         | 0.69.0+      |
| >=13.6.0         | 0.70.0+      |
| >=13.10.0        | 0.72.0+      |

## Troubleshooting

### Unexpected behavior

If you have unexpected behavior, please create a clean project with the latest versions of react-native and react-native-svg

```bash
react-native init CleanProject
cd CleanProject/
yarn add react-native-svg
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Make a reproduction of the problem in `App.js`

```bash
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```

### Adding Windows support

1. `npx react-native-windows-init --overwrite`
2. `cd windows\<AppName>`
3. Open `<AppName>.vcxproj`

#### RN 0.68+

4. Scroll to the bottom until you find:
   ```xml
   <ItemGroup>
      <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT" Version="X.X.XXXXXX.X" />
   </ItemGroup>
   ```
5. Add the following to that `<ItemGroup>`
   ```xml
   <PackageReference Include="Win2D.uwp" Version="1.26.0" />
   ```

#### Pre RN 0.68

4. Scroll to the bottom until you find:

   ```xml
   <ImportGroup Label="ExtensionTargets">
   ```

5. Add the following to that `<ImportGroup>`
   ```xml
   <Import Project="$(SolutionDir)\packages\Win2D.uwp.1.26.0\build\native\Win2D.uwp.targets" Condition="Exists('$(SolutionDir)\packages\Win2D.uwp.1.26.0\build\native\Win2D.uwp.targets')" />
   ```

## Opening issues

Verify that it is still an issue with the latest version as specified in the previous step. If so, open a new issue, include the entire `App.js` file, specify what platforms you've tested, and the results of running this command:

```bash
react-native info
```

If you suspect that you've found a spec conformance bug, then you can test using your component in a react-native-web project by forking this codesandbox, to see how different browsers render the same content: <https://codesandbox.io/s/pypn6mn3y7> If any evergreen browser with significant userbase or other svg user agent renders some svg content better, or supports more of the svg and related specs, please open an issue asap.
