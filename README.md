Install the JavaScript with:

```bash
expo install react-native-svg
```

## Support for Fabric

[Fabric](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/fabric-renderer) is React Native's new rendering system. As of [version `13.0.0`](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg/releases/tag/v13.0.0) of this project, Fabric is supported only for react-native 0.69.0+. Support for earlier versions is not possible due to breaking changes in configuration.

| react-native-svg | react-native |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| 13.0.0+          | 0.69.0+      |

## Troubleshooting

### Problems with Proguard

When Proguard is enabled (which it is by default for Android release builds), it causes runtime error.
To avoid this, add an exception to `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:

```bash
-keep public class com.horcrux.svg.** {*;}
```

If you have build errors, then it might be caused by caching issues, please try:

```bash
watchman watch-del-all
rm -fr $TMPDIR/react-*
react-native start --reset-cache

Or,

rm -rf node_modules
yarn
react-native start --reset-cache
```

### Unexpected behavior

If you have unexpected behavior, please create a clean project with the latest versions of react-native and react-native-svg

```bash
react-native init CleanProject
cd CleanProject/
yarn add react-native-svg
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Make a reproduction of the problem in `App.js`

```bash
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```

## Opening issues

Verify that it is still an issue with the latest version as specified in the previous step. If so, open a new issue, include the entire `App.js` file, specify what platforms you've tested, and the results of running this command:

```bash
react-native info
```

If you suspect that you've found a spec conformance bug, then you can test using your component in a react-native-web project by forking this codesandbox, to see how different browsers render the same content: <https://codesandbox.io/s/pypn6mn3y7> If any evergreen browser with significant userbase or other svg user agent renders some svg content better, or supports more of the svg and related specs, please open an issue asap.
